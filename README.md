# Swarming-Robots-Greenfoot

Here is a collection of the Greenfoot files and teaching resources used for my final year project dissertaion at Swansea University.
Projects also avaliable at https://www.greenfoot.org/users/52497

Require the Greenfoot IDE to run projects. Avaliable to download at https://www.greenfoot.org/home.

Note: Ignore GitHub the project code is written in Java not HTML. The Javadoc is HTML so it got confused.

# Swarming-Robots-Greenfoot

Here is a collection of the Greenfoot files and teaching resources used for my final year project on Teaching Computer Science Through Swarming Robots at Swansea University.

Greenfoot projects also avaliable to view and download at https://www.greenfoot.org/users/52497.

Require the Greenfoot IDE to run projects avaliable to download at https://www.greenfoot.org/home.

Note: Ignore GitHub the project code is written in Java not HTML. The Javadoc is HTML so it got confused.

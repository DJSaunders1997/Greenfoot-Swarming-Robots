Require the Greenfoot IDE to run projects avaliable to download at https://www.greenfoot.org/home.

Note: Ignore GitHub the project code is written in Java not HTML. The Javadoc is HTML so it got confused.

Help: If the projects launch, but cannot be viewed then edit the project file in notepad and change the last 2 lines to
    xPosition=0
    yPosition=0
